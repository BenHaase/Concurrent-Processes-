Assignment 2

To make both master and slave executable file use
	make -f makeass2
or
	make master
	make slave

make -f makeass2 will remove all .o files and the cstest file created
by running the program

To run the program use
	./master
or
	./master -t x
The -t option specifies the time limit on the program, where x should be
an integer value and represents time in seconds. If not specified the
default time used will be 60 seconds. On time out the master process
will kill all slave processes, clean up shared memory, and exit.

ctrl c (^C) signal will be intercepted by the master process who then
terminates the slave processes, cleans up shared memory, and exits.

The file which the slave processes write to is called "cstest" and
will be opened in append mode.

Description:
The master process spawns 19 slave processes who exec "slave" and
compete for a shared resource. The master process sets up shared
memory to hold a flag for each process and an integer to hold
which processes turn it is.  Upon the reciept of (^C) or a time out
all processes terminate. Slave processes will print messages to stderr
on: entry to CS, exit from the CS, failure to enter CS, upon performing
3 writes to the shared file before terminating, time out event, and (^C).
